All source code is protected under the GNU Public

This repository is meant as place to store the
source for the tools I find interesting, useful,
or meaningful enough to implement.

As I like to know how things work, and enjoy
sharing that knowlege with others, I will do my
best to document the code base in as much detail
as possible.

All code in this repository is written under the
philosophy of using nothing but the standard
library, meaning it should be trivial to add to an
existing project or code base.
